What is it and General Usage
----------------------------

Cmput 301 assignment 1 is a simple android to-do list app that lets the user create/edit/delete
tasks that he/she needs to accomplish. The user can set the task name, description,
days which the task will repeat and when the task should start. The user can complete
tasks and the completion will be documented in a completion log, where the user can view
or delete their past completions. 

To edit a task, a long hold on said task is required. Same with deleting past completions,
a long hold will reveal options for the user to do so.
